        <h1 style="text-align: center;">UWMCC Rebranding</h1>
        <p>One of the first on-campus clubs I was involved in is The University of Waterloo’s Management
            Consulting
            Club
            (UWMCC), a club that seeks attract students and help them acquire the basic skills needed to succeed
            in
            pursuing opportunities in the consulting industry.
            <br><br>
            Having been involved for four consecutive terms (as a marketing director, graphic designer, VP
            marketing,
            and now an advisor) I’ve seen and designed plenty of graphics for the club. As the club’s events are
            well
            known, I felt that it be important to establish a strong brand presence.

                <p>UWMCC holds an annual case competition where students from all universities can compete. Winter 2018
                    was
                    my first term on the team, as a marketing director I provided feedback for designs and helped to
                    promote
                    events on social media.

                <p>In Winter 2019, I was VP Marketing where I was responsible for creating all graphic deliverables.
                    Following the branding guide and using the previous year’s graphic for reference, I used Photoshop
                    and
                    Illustrator to create the following graphics.

                    To determine what content to include, I surveyed and asked a few friends for their opinion. The
                    majority agreed that keeping it as simple as possible and including the attending firms were
                    most important.

                <p>We thought designing different name tags was the best method for attendants to distinguish between
                    themselves. Judges had a fancy geometric background and unique layout whereas team members and
                    delegates
                    had the same layout but opposite color scheme. So team members could be found with ease, their
                    nametags
                    had a teal background to stand out.

    <!-- Event graphics -->
    <div class="space description">
        <h2 class="space">Event graphics</h2>
        <p class="content">As per the previous marketing guide UWMCC wanted a crisp and modern aesthetic, using
            geometric or business
            backgrounds, thin lines, banners, and the UWMCC teal. Keeping this in mind, I designed my first event
            graphic
            for the club.
        </p>

        <div class="row">

        <h2 class="space">Exploring aesthetics</h2>
        <p class="content">I felt that the previous graphics didn’t represent the modern brand that UWMCC wanted to
            portray. The teal shade was unsaturated. When used as an overlay it made background images dim, as shown in
            the Tech Consulting Day social media posts.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <p>While I felt the use of stock images delivered the purpose of the event well, the first thing I
                    wanted to change was the use of unsaturated teal overlays and images as backgrounds as I felt it
                    made the graphic seem clustered and messy. I also explored using vibrant teals/blues for emphasis.
                </p>

            <div class="col-lg-8">

            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <p>Afterwards, I thought of how I can correlate graphics better with the consulting industry and what
                    better way to represent the industry than to incorporate a PowerPoint style layout!

            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p class="content space">Although the new designs were preferred, the feedback mentioned that the light colors didn’t allow the post to stand out when a user scrolls through their timeline. Taking this into consideration I switched up the color scheme again and played around with gradients, which is a current design trend I personally love.
