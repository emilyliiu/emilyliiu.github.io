            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The University of Waterloo Management Consulting Club (UWMCC) aims to attract help students acquire the
                basic skills needed to succeed in pursuing opportunities in the consulting industry. I joined the team
                in my 1B term as a graphic designer, not knowing what exactly consulting is. Over the term, I realized I
                love problem solving and working with the team. Since then, I have had the role of Marketing
                Coordinator, VP Marketing, Case Committee, and Advisor. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h2>Why's this in my Portfolio?</h2>
                    <p>Having been involved since first-year, I felt that my designs for UWMCC really shows my progress. Specifically, with deciding the placement of things for marketing purposes, designing for the targeted audience, and use of typography and whitespace. </p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Although UWMCC is well-known on campus, I felt that our marketing materials do not represent a brand
                    due to a lack of consistency in color and design style.
                    <br>
                    Aside from consistency the teal color used is quite dull – when used as a background or overlay
                    color, it washes out the saturation of other images, resulting in a boring, outdated, or
                    overly-professional feel.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Over the terms, I began to create different styles of designs for graphic deliverables. I referenced
                    graphics from MBB and Big 4, played around with different shades of teal, and adopted various styles
                    from mimicking PowerPoints to something more contemporary. </p>

            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>UWMCC holds an annual case competition where students from all universities can compete. Winter 2018
                    was my first term on the team, as a marketing director I provided feedback for designs and helped to
                    promote events on social media.

                    Following the branding guide and using the previous year’s graphic for reference, I used Photoshop
                    and
                    Illustrator to create the following graphics.

                    most important.

                <p>We thought designing different name tags was the best method for attendants to distinguish between

                    delegates
                    had the same layout but opposite color scheme. So team members could be found with ease, their
                    nametags
                    had a teal background to stand out.

        <h2 class="space">Event graphics</h2>
        <p class="content">As per the previous marketing guide UWMCC wanted a crisp and modern aesthetic, using
            geometric or business
            backgrounds, thin lines, banners, and the UWMCC teal. Keeping this in mind, I designed my first event
            graphic
            for the club.

        <h2 class="space">Exploring aesthetics</h2>
        <p class="content">I felt that the previous graphics didn’t represent the modern brand that UWMCC wanted to
            portray. The teal shade was unsaturated. When used as an overlay it made background images dim, as shown in
            the Tech Consulting Day social media posts.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <p>While I felt the use of stock images delivered the purpose of the event well, the first thing I
                    wanted to change was the use of unsaturated teal overlays and images as backgrounds as I felt it
                    made the graphic seem clustered and messy. I also explored using vibrant teals/blues for emphasis.

                <p>Afterwards, I thought of how I can correlate graphics better with the consulting industry and what
                    better way to represent the industry than to incorporate a PowerPoint style layout!

        <p class="content space">Although the new designs were preferred, the feedback mentioned that the light colors
            didn’t allow the post to stand out when a user scrolls through their timeline. Taking this into
            consideration I switched up the color scheme again and played around with gradients, which is a current
            design trend I personally love.
