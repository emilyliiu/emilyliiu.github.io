    <!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
    <div class="container">
        <div class="description">
            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>Many young adults have little to no knowledge about finance, especially when it comes to investing.
                Young Funds Program (YFP) is a student-run initiative aimed towards developing financial literacy in
                young adults.
                According to Travis, the founder, their primary goals are to:
                <ol>
                    <li>Increase user engagement </li>
                    <li>Showcase YFP’s offerings</li>
                    <li>Emphasize the importance of starting early</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h2>Work Distribution:</h2>
            <p>All members took a hands-on approach where we would create individual mockups, present to each other, and
                collectively decide which aspects of each persons designs could be combined to achieve YFP's goals.
                To simplfy decision making, we each took intiative over a certain role. I was responsible for:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Managing the team:</b> keeping up with deadlines, proofing, and re-formatting deliverables to
                        be presentable.</li>
                    <li><b>Development:</b> I wanted more practice with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in preparation for
                        developing my own portfolio.</li>
                    <li><b>Research:</b> messenger between client and team, conducted user and market research, and UI
                        industry trends.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Pain points:</h2>
            <p>As someone who is interested in learning about investing but has little to no exposure on the topic,
                I fit into the target demographic perfectly. To get a broader perspective with less bias, I also
                asked a few friends to share their thoughts on the site as well.
                Afterward, I grouped them into three categories and concluded the main pain points to be:

        <h2>Wireframes pt.1</h2>
        <p>According to
            <a class="highlight" href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/chartbeat-website-engagement-data-nj">HubSpot
            </a>, young adults typically spend less than 15 seconds on a website.
            Therefore, my redesign aims to get the purpose, offerings, and organization's goal across as quick
            and seamless as possible.
            <br> To do this I focused on three main aspects: </p>

        <h3>1. Content</h3>
        <p>The first step was to produce a sitemap to re-organize and map out the information architecture.
            YFP's mission statement would be clearly stated on the homepage for utmost visibility.
            The homepage would include a short summary of each subpage along with a call to action button so the user
            can navigate to the subpage if the wished.
            Repetitive content were grouped together and displayed together in subpages, which would reduce the length
            of the page and make content more attractive to users.
        </p>

            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <p>Replicating common layout designs, I decided to separate sections by changing the
                    background color and grouping similar information together using cards. </p>
            </div>
        </div> -->

    <div class="space container description">
        <h3>2. Design</h3>
        <p>Wanting to instil a minimalistic yet professional feel to the site, I did some research
            by looking popular finance and education websites, such as
            <a class="highlight" href="https://www.investopedia.com/">Investopedia</a>,
            <a class="highlight" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/">Nasdaq</a>,
            <a class="highlight" href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khanacademy</a>, and more.
            <br><br>
            Finding overlapping UI elements (eg. use of stock photos, color palet, homepage layout, etc.) helped with
            deciding which design elements and
            principles to focus on to successfully replicate a trustworthy brand image, a crucial component to
            attracting more clients.
            <br><br>
            I decided to get rid of the distracting animations all together, adopt a sans serif font that is youthful
            and approachable,
            alternate the background color to separate between sections, and use plenty of relevant stock images.

        <h3>3. Usability</h3>
        <p>Irrelevant links were either removed or grouped into subcategories to clean up the
            navigation menu and the repetitive menu was also removed from the footer. Additionally,
            I used a lighter shade to highlight the current active page instead of complimentary
            colors. <br>
            Keeping YFP’s goal of increasing user engagement in mind, all pages ended with a call to
            action. Therefore, users can easily reach out to YFP and the user experience doesn’t
            end awkwardly with the user being unsure of what to do next.

        <p>While the homepage provides an overview, having 'Learn
            More' call-to-actions increases engagement, gives with more control over the information
            users wish to
            know, and the time they want to spend on the page. If the user
            is interested in learning more about a certain section, they can access that sub-page at
            ease by clicking 'Learn More'. If the user is not interested, they can simply

    <p>We conducted a few rounds of user testing and made changes accordingly. The main feedback points we recieved was that there is too much going on, testers were unsure which part of the site to focus on first and kept getting distracted by other elements.
        Based on the feedback, we made the following changes:
        <ul>
            <li>Toned down the neon green to darker forest green, used sparingly rather than as backgrounds</li>
            <li>Increased padding between sections and child elements to improve readability and establish hierarchy</li>
            <li>Did more research to understand what information competitors would and wouldn't highlighted</li>
            <li>Cleaned up navigation menu by removing duplicate social media icons</li>

        <h2>Improvements:</h2>
        <p>
                Although we had a good understanding of YFP's mission, goals, and offerings, more communication could
                have occurred between the team and Travis. By including Travis in the design process, we could have
                restructured the sitemap to be catered more towards what YFP prefers.</p>

            <h4>Design:</h4> 
        <p>Researching more into the psychology of color theory would have been helpful in positioning the brand as professional, youthful, and inviting. 
            Additionally, if Travis hires a photographer in his future events, replacing the stock images with those would provide a more personalized touch and appear more trustworthy.</p>

            <h4>Usability:</h4> 
            <p>Using a popup box for users to subscribe, connect, or sign-up would
            increase the probability of getting sign-ups from users as it prevents the user from having to take an
            extra step.</p>

            <h4>Content:</h4> 
            <p>Working more with Travis and individuals in the target market will help us understand what they care about most and generate user personas. Afterwards this research, content can be restructured accordingly </p>
        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <h4>Go mobile: </h4> 
        <p> I definitely think to develop a mobile version of the site would be extremely
            beneficial to YFP as young adults (the target audience) browse information on their phones more often
            than desktops</p>

            <h4>Testing:</h4> 
            <p>Due to the scope of the project, we only went through 2 full rounds of
            iterations, therefore plenty of usability/UI issues might have been overseen.
            For example, buttons and submission forms should be kept consistent throughout the site and analyzing how users actually engage and navigate through the site will validate whether
            the chosen layout and organization of information is sustainable or not.</p> 

            <h4>Benchmark study:</h4> 
            <p>Tracking the conversions between impressions and sign-ups of the new site when
            compared to the existing site would also be a good indicator of the successfulness of the redesign.</p>
