                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The motivation behind this project was for one of my second-year classes, where teams of four
                    worked together to revamp and develop a website for a local organization.
                    Young Funds Program (YFP) is a student-run initiative aimed towards developing financial
                    literacy amongst young adults, with the primary goals being:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Increase user engagement </li>
                        <li>Showcase YFP’s offerings</li>
                        <li>Emphasize the importance of starting early</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h2>Work Distribution</h2>
                <p>All team members critiqued and presented our wireframes and recommendations to one another.
                    Gina and I split leadership over the project, finalized the design created by Nish and
                    Sakksham for development, and developed the site using HTML, CSS, and bits of Javascript.</p>

        <h2>Pain points:</h2>
        <p>As someone who is interested in learning about investing but has little to no exposure on the topic,
            I fit into the target demographic perfectly. To get a broader perspective with less bias, I also
            asked a few friends to share their thoughts on the site as well.
            Afterward, I grouped them into three categories and concluded the main pain points to be:
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <h3>Inconsistency in design</h3>

                <p>The various shades of purple for the background, different header styles, and choice of stock
                    photos causes the site to appear disorganized. Users also thought the addition of floating
                    animations didn’t add to the design and were rather distracting.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <h3>Content disorganization</h3>
                <img class="gif" src="../pages/YFP/yfp-design-critique.gif" width="290" alt="yfp content critique">
                <p>A lack of hierarchy and spacing between different content groups made it difficult for users
                    to navigate through the site and comprehend the information.
                    Additionally, there is plenty of repetitive information scattered around the site. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <h3>Usability difficulties</h3>
                <img class="gif" src="../pages/YFP/yfp-nav-critique.gif" width="290"
                    alt="yfp navigation menus critique">
                <p>Users found that repeating the navigation menu in the footer to be unnecessary and that there
                    were far too many links, many of which can be grouped and condensed.</p>
            </div>


            <h2 class="space">Wireframes pt.1</h2>
            <p>YFP mainly targets young adults who, according to a
                <a class="highlight"
                    href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/chartbeat-website-engagement-data-nj">HubSpot
                    article</a>, typically spend less than 15 seconds on the website.
                Therefore, my redesign aims to get the purpose, offerings, and organization's goal across as quick
                and seamless as possible.
                <br> To do this I focused on three main aspects:

                <h3>Content</h3>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-10">
                        <p>The first step was to re-organize the pages and content to be included so that a sitemap
                            could be developed. The sitemap will serve as the basis for determining how content will
                            be grouped, specifically how to determine h1, h2, etc. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-5">

                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                        <p>The objective of YFP is clearly stated and displayed at the top for utmost visibility so
                            when a user visits, they know exactly what the site will be about.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                        <p>Replicating common layout designs, I decided to separate sections by changing the
                            background color and grouping similar information together using cards. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-lg-6">
                        <p>Wanting to instil a minimalistic and professional feel to the site, I did some research
                            by looking popular finance and education websites, such as
                            <a class="highlight" href="https://www.investopedia.com/">Investopedia</a>,
                            <a class="highlight" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/">Nasdaq</a>,
                            and <a class="highlight" href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khanacademy</a>.
                            <br><br>
                            Assessing the similarities between the sites helped me decide what design elements and
                            principles to focus on to successfully replicate a trustworthy brand image, as as if I
                            were to be a potential client that’s what I’d want from an investing advisor.
                            <br><br>
                            I decided to get rid of the animations all together and use a sans serif font for
                            simplicity,
                            alternating background color to separate between sections, and use plenty of relevant stock
                            images.

                <p>After reviewing the wireframes, I suggested we add padding between content blocks to make it
                    appear less clustered and divert from using neon greens as it appears more playful rather than
                    professional.
                    Taking into consideration of mine and Gina's suggestions, we iterated the wireframes once more
                    before development.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Although we had a good understanding of YFP's mission, goals, and offerings, more communication could
                have occurred between the team and Travis. By having Travis apart of the design process, we could have
                filtered the content to be catered more towards what YFP prefers.
                After all, maybe we decided to not include information that YFP might have thought to be vital to their
                organization. Additionally, due to the scope of the project, we only went through a few rounds of
                iterations, therefore plenty of usability/UI issues might have been overseen.
                For example, buttons and submission forms should be kept consistent throughout the site.
            </p>
            <h3>Improvements:</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Design:</b> gradients are currently a popular UI trend that YFP can take advantage of. Instead of
                simply using green to highlight call-to-actions or key messages, a gradient from the previous neon green
                to the current forest green
                can be used.
                <br>
                <b>Usability:</b> using jQuery to add a popup box for users to subscribe or connect with YFP would
                increase the probability of getting sign-ups from users as well as help users understand that the site
                wants to connect with them.
                Additionally, including popups for all "sign-up" buttons would prevent the user from having to take an
                additional step in getting connected.
                <br>
                <b>Content:</b> the current redesign uses plenty of stock photos, which can potentially give off an
                untrustworthy vibe to the user. We could have reached out to Travis for first-hand photos or other media
                content, which would
                help build the brand as well.
            </p>
            <h3>Next steps</h3>
            <p> <b>Go mobile: </b>I definitely think to develop a mobile version of the site would be extremely
                beneficial to YFP as the majority of the target audience browse information on their phones more often
                than desktops.
                <br>
                <b>Testing:</b> analyzing how users actually engage and navigate through the site will validate whether
                the chosen layout and organization of information is sustainable or not.
                <br>
                <b>Benchmark study:</b> tracking the conversions between impressions and sign-ups of the new site when
                compared to the existing site would also be a good indicator of the successfulness of the redesign.
