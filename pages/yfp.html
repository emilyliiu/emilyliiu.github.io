                        <h4>Background</h4>
                        <p>This was a project for one of my classes, where teams of four worked together to redesign and develop a small website for a local start up. 
                            Luckily, one of my friends runs Young Funds Program (YFP) and agreed to let us redesign the website. YFP is a student initiative aimed towards developing financial literacy amongst young adults.
                            The project included individual and group components. As we are still in the process of developing the final redesign report, the work shown at the moment will only include my design process and deliverables.

                    <h4>Research process</h4>
                        </p> Before the project, I had already worked with Travis, the founder, and created various graphic deliverables for events he hosted. Therefore, I was already familiar with YFP’s goals and offerings. 
                            I also considered the different types of users that would be interested in YFP and what they would want to get out of the website. Below are user personas that displays my findings.

                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Navigation difficulties: </b>the main feedback we received was that it’s difficult to navigate through the site as information was scattered all over the page and call to action items were unclear. 
                                Users also noted that the menu included too many links, making it unclear as to what YFP is. </li>
                            <li><b>Content disorganization: </b> students found that it was difficult to understand the purpose of the website due to a lack of hierarchy between groups of contents. 
                                Additionally, there weren’t clear headings or spacing between different sections of content, making it difficult for the user to understand the message YFP is trying to convey.  
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Overall aesthetics: </b>there was a lack of consistency throughout the site and the use of purple and green clashed. 
                                Furthermore, the use of animations didn’t add to the design, instead it was distracting. Overall, the site didn’t appear to be very professional.

                    <h2>The design process</h2>
                    <h4>Wireframes pt. 1</h4>
                       <p>The biggest challenge I had was determining how to organize content to reduce repeated information and creating a layout that allows for easy information delivery to the user. 
                        I began by researching other educational/portfolio management sites to get a better understanding of the way they organized information and the common layouts. 
                        Afterwards, I created wireframes using Adobe XD to showcase the basic layout for the site.

                    <h4>Wireframes pt. 2</h4>
                       <p>Then, I began to play around with the layout to make it more engaging and more interesting to look at.

                    <h4>Wireframes pt. 3</h4>
                       <p>Afterwards, I came up with a color scheme that would portray the professional yet trendy brand image.

                    <h4>Next steps</h4>
                       <p>One of the group member is currently taking on the responsibility to develop both low and high-fidelity wireframes for all the pages on the site. 
                           Afterwards, myself and another group member will have around one week to develop the website using HTML5 and CSS.
