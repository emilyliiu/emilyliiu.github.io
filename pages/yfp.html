    <!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
    <div class="container">
        <div class="description">
            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>Many young adults have little to no knowledge about finance, especially when it comes to investing.
                Young Funds Program (YFP) is a student-run initiative aimed towards developing financial literacy in
                young adults.
                According to Travis, the founder, their primary goals are to:
                <ol>
                    <li>Increase user engagement </li>
                    <li>Showcase YFP’s offerings</li>
                    <li>Emphasize the importance of starting early</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h2>Work Distribution:</h2>
            <p>All members took a hands-on approach where we would create individual mockups, present to each other, and
                collectively decide which aspects of each persons designs could be combined to achieve YFP's goals.
                To simplfy decision making, we each took intiative over a certain role. I was responsible for:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Managing the team:</b> keeping up with deadlines, proofing, and re-formatting deliverables to
                        be presentable.</li>
                    <li><b>Development:</b> I wanted more practice with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in preparation for
                        developing my own portfolio.</li>
                    <li><b>Research:</b> messenger between client and team, conducted user and market research, and UI
                        industry trends.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Pain points:</h2>
            <p>As someone who is interested in learning about investing but has little to no exposure on the topic,
                I fit into the target demographic perfectly. To get a broader perspective with less bias, I also
                asked a few friends to share their thoughts on the site as well.
                Afterward, I grouped them into three categories and concluded the main pain points to be:

        <h2>Wireframes pt.1</h2>
        <p>According to
            <a class="highlight" href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/chartbeat-website-engagement-data-nj">HubSpot
            </a>, young adults typically spend less than 15 seconds on a website.
            Therefore, my redesign aims to get the purpose, offerings, and organization's goal across as quick
            and seamless as possible.
            <br> To do this I focused on three main aspects: </p>

        <h3>1. Content</h3>
        <p>The first step was to produce a sitemap to re-organize and map out the information architecture.
            YFP's mission statement would be clearly stated on the homepage for utmost visibility.
            The homepage would include a short summary of each subpage along with a call to action button so the user
            can navigate to the subpage if the wished.
            Repetitive content were grouped together and displayed together in subpages, which would reduce the length
            of the page and make content more attractive to users.

            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <p>Replicating common layout designs, I decided to separate sections by changing the
                    background color and grouping similar information together using cards. </p>
            </div>
        </div> -->

    <div class="space container description">
        <h3>2. Design</h3>
        <p>Wanting to instil a minimalistic and professional feel to the site, I did some research
            by looking popular finance and education websites, such as
            <a class="highlight" href="https://www.investopedia.com/">Investopedia</a>,
            <a class="highlight" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/">Nasdaq</a>,
            and <a class="highlight" href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khanacademy</a>.
            <br><br>
            Assessing the similarities between the sites helped me decide what design elements and
            principles to focus on to successfully replicate a trustworthy brand image, as as if I
            were to be a potential client that’s what I’d want from an investing advisor.
            <br><br>
            I decided to get rid of the animations all together and use a sans serif font for
            simplicity,
            alternating background color to separate between sections, and use plenty of relevant stock
            images.

        <h3>3. Usability</h3>
        <p>Irrelevant links were either removed or grouped into subcategories to clean up the
            navigation menu and the repetitive menu was also removed from the footer. Additionally,
            I used a lighter shade to highlight the current active page instead of complimentary
            colors.</p>

    <!-- <div class="col-lg-5">
        <p>While the homepage provides an overview, having 'Learn
            More' call-to-actions increases engagement, gives with more control over the information
            users wish to
            know, and the time they want to spend on the page. If the user
            is interested in learning more about a certain section, they can access that sub-page at
            ease by clicking 'Learn More'. If the user is not interested, they can simply
            scroll to the next section</p>

    </div>

    <div class="row space">
        <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>By adding padding and consistent heading styles, hierarchy between content blocks were
                established. This helped to portray a more organized and professional brand image as well as
                easily convey information to the user.</p>

            Keeping YFP’s goal of increasing user engagement in mind, I ended each page with a call to
            action. Therefore, users can easily reach out to YFP and so that the user experience doesn’t
            end
            awkwardly with the user being unsure of what to do next.

        <p>After reviewing each other's wireframes, Nish and Sakksham collaborated to combine the best
            aspects of everyone's wireframes into one and went through the site to organize the content. </p>

                Nish wanted to maximize social media traffic by ensuring that social media links were included
                in both the navigation menu and the footer. As we cleaned up the footer we decided to adopt a

            Taking into consideration of mine and Gina's suggestions, we iterated the wireframes once more
            before development.

    <section id="#reflection" class="space container description">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Although we had a good understanding of YFP's mission, goals, and offerings, more communication could
            have occurred between the team and Travis. By having Travis apart of the design process, we could have
            filtered the content to be catered more towards what YFP prefers.
            After all, maybe we decided to not include information that YFP might have thought to be vital to their
            organization. Additionally, due to the scope of the project, we only went through a few rounds of
            iterations, therefore plenty of usability/UI issues might have been overseen.
            For example, buttons and submission forms should be kept consistent throughout the site.
        </p>
        <h3>Improvements:</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Design:</b> gradients are currently a popular UI trend that YFP can take advantage of. Instead of
            simply using green to highlight call-to-actions or key messages, a gradient from the previous neon green
            to the current forest green
            can be used.
            <br>
            <b>Usability:</b> using jQuery to add a popup box for users to subscribe or connect with YFP would
            increase the probability of getting sign-ups from users as well as help users understand that the site
            wants to connect with them.
            Additionally, including popups for all "sign-up" buttons would prevent the user from having to take an
            additional step in getting connected.
            <br>
            <b>Content:</b> the current redesign uses plenty of stock photos, which can potentially give off an
            untrustworthy vibe to the user. We could have reached out to Travis for first-hand photos or other media
            content, which would
            help build the brand as well.
        </p>
        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <p> <b>Go mobile: </b>I definitely think to develop a mobile version of the site would be extremely
            beneficial to YFP as the majority of the target audience browse information on their phones more often
            than desktops.
            <br>
            <b>Testing:</b> analyzing how users actually engage and navigate through the site will validate whether
            the chosen layout and organization of information is sustainable or not.
            <br>
            <b>Benchmark study:</b> tracking the conversions between impressions and sign-ups of the new site when
            compared to the existing site would also be a good indicator of the successfulness of the redesign.
