                  <h4>Background</h4>
                  <p>
                    The motivation behind this project was for one of my
                    second-year classes, where teams of four worked together to
                    redesign and develop a website for a local organization.
                    Luckily, one of my friends runs an initiative, Young Funds
                    Program (YFP), and was looking to revamp the website. YFP
                    aims to develop financial literacy amongst young adults
                    through offering services, such as workshops and personal
                    consultation.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-7">
                  <h4>Distribution of work</h4>
                  <p>
                    We individually completed a critique of the current website,
                    wireframes, and presented our recommendations to one another
                    for feedback. After sharing and discussing our findings in
                    terms of usability, design, and content, we split into
                    pairs.
                    <br /><br />
                    Nish and Sakksham were responsible for creating the final
                    wireframes, deciding design aspects (font and color pallet),
                    and creating the final presentation.
                    <br /><br />
                    Gina and I split leadership over the project, finalized the
                    prototype for development, and developed the site using
                    HTML/CSS and bits of Javascript.

                    <b>Navigation difficulties: </b>the main feedback we
                    received was that it’s difficult to navigate through the
                    site as information was scattered all over the page and call
                    to action items were unclear. Users also noted that the menu
                    included too many links, making it unclear as to what YFP
                    is.

                  <li>
                    <b>Content disorganization: </b> students found that it was
                    difficult to understand the purpose of the website due to a
                    lack of hierarchy between groups of contents. Additionally,
                    there weren’t clear headings or spacing between different
                    sections of content, making it difficult for the user to
                    understand the message YFP is trying to convey.

                  <li>
                    <b>Overall aesthetics: </b>there was a lack of consistency
                    throughout the site and the use of purple and green clashed.
                    Furthermore, the use of animations didn’t add to the design,
                    instead it was distracting. Overall, the site didn’t appear
                    to be very professional.

                <p>Working closely with Travis allowed us to get a good understanding of how to successfully cater the redesign to the target audience. 
                    With this in mind, I researched the layout and common themes between other finance and educational service websites. 
                    As young adults typically scan rather than read, I focused on re-organizing content so that a user can easily understand the 
                    purpose and offerings YFP provides when scrolling through the main page. Clear call to action buttons is included at almost every 
                    content block so that if the user is interested, they can easily click to learn more. The homepage also ends with a call to action for the user to 
                    sign-up as the purpose of the website is to both educate and connect with potential clients.

                <h4 id="wf">Wireframes pt. 1</h4>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge I had was determining how to organize
                    content to reduce repeated information and creating a layout
                    that allows for easy information delivery to the user. I began
                    by researching other educational/portfolio management sites to
                    get a better understanding of the way they organized
                    information and the common layouts. Afterwards, I created
                    wireframes using Adobe XD to showcase the basic layout for the
                    site.

                <p>
                  Then, I began to play around with the layout to make it more
                  engaging and more interesting to look at.

                  Afterwards, I came up with a color scheme that would portray
