                    ShowMi is a passion project originally driven by a personal pain point of mine. I love attending
                    concerts, music festivals, jazz festivals, etc. However, I can never keep track of which events I‚Äôve
                    been to, never-the-less list out all the artists I‚Äôve seen (virtual and live). Below shows a brief
                    overview of the process:

                    I wanted to really dive into understand why it‚Äôs frustrating, when people feel frustrated, and how

                <p>I began by doing some research to see what‚Äôs out there currently. I noted down the popular platforms,
                    identified the key features I envisioned ShowMi to have, and reassessed the existing platforms based
                    on those features. To my surprise, there‚Äôs literally a multiple tracking app for everything‚Ä¶ except
                    historical data for attendees.

                            alternatives for artists tracking event attendance, rather than attendees tracking artists
                            they‚Äôve seen. </li>
                        <li>Attendees can <b>‚Äòtrack‚Äô artists‚Äô for upcoming tour information/concerts</b> in the future

                    And how I would go about showing that. I did some A/B testing and found that despite Wireframe A

                    on the lineup data and sorted alphabetically. The user can navigate between the festival days and
                    simply tap to add or remove an artist.

                <h3>HMW make adding artists EVEN MORE effortless?</h3>
                <p>Beyond keeping interactions and distractions to a minimum, I also researched on common best practice
                    patterns for how artists are displayed vs. events. I also asked interviewees what they notice and
                    care about for both artists and events.

                    <b>Key takeaways ‚Äì Resarch</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Profile pictures/avatars typically use circles whereas events use square images
                        </li>

                        <li>Events have much more necessary information than artists (ie. address, date(s), time, etc.)
                        </li>

                        <li>Only using circle/image differentiator isn‚Äôt enough ‚Äì often the event feature image is the
                            same as the artist profiles image
                        </li>

                        <li>Interviewees needed information to validate the event is the one they attended (ie. Artist
                            on tours with multiple dates/venues)</li>

                <h3>HMW design better event cards?</h3>
                <p>Events include a plethora of information and I quickly found that one size does NOT fit all.
                    Showcasing all that info on a small mobile screen would be extremely overwhelming, especially when
                    there are numerous events users can scroll through.
                    <b>Key takeaways</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users need to quickly validate that the event they searched for is the one they attended
                        </li>

                        <li>Users need more incentivizing information when exploring events to see if it‚Äôs of interest

                        </li>

                        <li>Research showed that the hierarchy of information is:
                            1. Image
                            2. Event name
